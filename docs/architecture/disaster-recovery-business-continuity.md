# Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity

## Backup Strategy

**Data Backup Architecture:**
```typescript
interface BackupStrategy {
  // Database backups
  databaseBackup: {
    frequency: "Automated daily snapshots"
    retention: "Daily for 30 days, weekly for 1 year"
    location: "Multiple Australian regions"
    testing: "Monthly restore testing"
  }
  
  // File storage backups
  fileBackup: {
    swmsDocuments: "Real-time replication + daily snapshots"
    siteMaps: "Daily backup with versioning"
    templates: "Weekly backup sufficient"
    retention: "7 years for compliance documents"
  }
  
  // Configuration backups
  configBackup: {
    environmentVariables: "Encrypted weekly backup"
    databaseSchema: "Version controlled in Git"
    deploymentConfig: "Git repository backup"
    certificates: "Secure weekly backup"
  }
}
```

## Recovery Procedures

**Disaster Recovery Plan:**
```typescript
interface DisasterRecovery {
  // Service level objectives
  slo: {
    rto: "2 hours for admin functions"  // Recovery Time Objective
    rpo: "15 minutes for data loss"     // Recovery Point Objective
    availability: "99.9% monthly uptime"
  }
  
  // Recovery procedures
  procedures: {
    databaseFailure: {
      detection: "Automated monitoring alerts"
      response: "Switch to standby replica"
      recovery: "Point-in-time restore if needed"
      validation: "Data integrity checks"
    }
    
    frontendFailure: {
      detection: "Netlify uptime monitoring"
      response: "Automatic CDN failover"
      recovery: "Rebuild and redeploy"
      validation: "Full smoke test suite"
    }
    
    completeOutage: {
      detection: "Multi-point monitoring failure"
      response: "Emergency communication to users"
      recovery: "Full environment rebuild"
      validation: "Comprehensive system testing"
    }
  }
}
```
