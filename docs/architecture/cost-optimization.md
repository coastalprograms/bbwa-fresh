# Cost Optimization

## Cost Management Strategy

**Infrastructure Cost Analysis:**
```typescript
interface CostOptimization {
  // Current cost baseline
  currentCosts: {
    supabase: "$25/month (Pro plan)"
    netlify: "$19/month (Pro plan)"
    domain: "$15/year"
    monitoring: "$0 (included in platform costs)"
    totalMonthly: "~$44/month"
  }
  
  // SWMS feature cost impact
  additionalCosts: {
    edgeFunctionUsage: "+$5-10/month (email automation)"
    storageIncrease: "+$2-5/month (document storage)"
    bandwidthIncrease: "+$1-3/month (portal traffic)"
    externalServices: "$0 (using included services)"
    totalAdditional: "+$8-18/month"
  }
  
  // Cost optimization strategies
  optimizationStrategies: {
    databaseOptimization: "Regular query performance review"
    storageCleanup: "Automated cleanup of expired tokens"
    functionOptimization: "Edge function performance tuning"
    bandwidthOptimization: "Image and asset optimization"
  }
}
