# Story 1.1: Contractor-Employee Hierarchy Foundation

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** builder admin,
**I want** to establish proper contractor-employee relationships in the database,
**so that** I can organize workers by their employer companies for compliance tracking.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create contractors table with company information (name, ABN, contact details)
2. Add contractor_id foreign key to workers table
3. Replace free-text company field in worker induction form with contractor dropdown

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist (this is the first story in Epic 1).

### Data Models
**Contractors Table Schema [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#swms-enhancement-tables]:**
- Primary table for company records (CR2 requirement)
- Links to existing workers table via foreign key
- Must include ABN for Australian business number compliance
- Follows existing table patterns with UUID primary key and RLS

**Workers Table Enhancement:**
- Add contractor_id foreign key to existing workers table
- Maintains existing structure: first_name, last_name, email, trade, phone
- Replace free-text company field with contractor relationship
- Preserve all existing functionality (check-in, certifications)

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/[timestamp]_create_contractors_table.sql`
- **Types**: `src/types/contractors.ts`
- **Induction Form**: `apps/web/src/app/induction/page.tsx` (existing)
- **Admin Interface**: Future story will add `apps/web/src/app/admin/contractors/`

### API Specifications [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#server-actions-pattern]
- Follow existing patterns in `/api/admin/job-sites/` for future contractor endpoints
- Use Server Actions pattern for form handling
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Return consistent response format: `{ success: boolean; error?: string }`

### Database Patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#database-patterns]
- **RLS Required**: All new tables must implement RLS policies
- **Authentication**: Use `auth.uid()` for user-specific access
- **Query Pattern**: Type-safe queries with proper error handling
- **Migration Pattern**: Follow existing timestamp convention

### Security Constraints [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#security]
- Row Level Security on contractors table following workers table pattern
- Authenticated users only for admin operations
- Public access only for induction form contractor selection
- Audit trails for all data changes

### Integration Verification Requirements
- IV1: Existing worker check-in functionality continues operating without modification
- IV2: Current worker management interface displays contractor names correctly
- IV3: All existing worker data maintains integrity during contractor migration

### Testing Requirements
**Framework [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]:**
- Jest + React Testing Library for components
- Minimum 80% coverage for new code
- Location: `__tests__` directories or `.test.tsx` files

**Test Cases Required:**
- Unit tests for contractor database operations
- Integration tests for induction form with contractor dropdown
- Migration testing to ensure data integrity
- API route testing with mock Supabase client

**Critical Test Scenarios:**
- Worker induction flow with contractor selection
- Existing worker check-in continues working
- Data migration preserves all existing worker information

### Agent Model Used
Claude Opus 4.1 (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)

### Debug Log References
- Initial QA review failed with FAIL gate due to UI components not using contractor relationships
- User request: "/dev You need to fix what quin has said"
- Fixed admin workers page to query contractor relationship instead of company field
- Fixed worker detail page to display contractor information
- Created comprehensive test coverage for contractor functionality

### Completion Notes List
- ✓ Database migrations already complete with proper RLS policies
- ✓ TypeScript types already defined for contractors
- ✓ Worker induction form already had contractor dropdown implemented (AC 3 was actually complete)
- ✓ Fixed admin workers page to use contractor relationship query
- ✓ Fixed worker detail page to show contractor name and ABN
- ✓ Created comprehensive tests for both admin interface and induction actions
- ✓ All critical UI gaps identified in QA review have been resolved

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Partial Implementation Status**: Database layer is well-implemented with proper migrations, TypeScript types, and RLS policies. However, critical UI components have not been updated to use the new contractor relationships, creating a disconnect between the data model and user interface.

### Refactoring Performed

None - story requires development completion before refactoring can be safely applied.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Database migrations follow established patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Files organized according to standards  
- Testing Strategy: ✗ No tests found for contractor functionality
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC 3 (contractor dropdown) appears unimplemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention:**

- [ ] Update admin workers page query to join contractor table (apps/web/src/app/admin/workers/page.tsx:45-59)
- [ ] Replace company display with contractor name in admin interface (apps/web/src/app/admin/workers/page.tsx:107,132) 
- [ ] Implement contractor dropdown in worker induction/registration form (AC 3)
- [ ] Create unit tests for contractor model and validation
- [ ] Add integration tests for forms with contractor dropdown
- [ ] Test data migration on copy of production data

**Future Improvements:**

- [ ] Remove legacy company column after UI migration complete
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling for contractor relationships
- [ ] Consider adding contractor management interface for admin users

### Security Review

✓ **PASS**: RLS policies properly implemented following existing worker table patterns. Public read access for active contractors (needed for induction form) with authenticated-only write permissions.

### Performance Considerations  

✓ **PASS**: Proper indexes created on contractors table (name, abn, active) and foreign key relationship (workers.contractor_id). Query performance should be good.

### Files Modified During Review

None - identified issues require development work, not QA refactoring.

### Acceptance Criteria Analysis

1. ✓ **Create contractors table** - Completed with proper schema, indexes, RLS
2. ✓ **Add contractor_id foreign key** - Completed with index and constraints  
3. ✗ **Replace company field with contractor dropdown** - NOT IMPLEMENTED
4. ✓ **Create data migration** - Completed with proper data preservation
5. ✓ **Implement proper RLS policies** - Completed following established patterns

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.1-contractor-employee-hierarchy-foundation.yml

**Risk Assessment**: HIGH - UI components not updated to use contractor relationships creates potential for runtime errors and data inconsistency.

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required** - Critical UI components need implementation before story can be marked as complete. Database foundation is solid but user-facing functionality is incomplete.

**Story owner must address high-priority UI issues before moving to Done status.**
