## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies & Prerequisites
**Contractors Table Status (from Story 1.1):**
- **REQUIRED**: Contractors table MUST exist before implementing swms_submissions
- **Schema**: id (UUID), name (TEXT), abn (TEXT), contact_email (TEXT), contact_phone (TEXT), address (TEXT), active (BOOLEAN), created_at, updated_at
- **Implementation**: If contractors table doesn't exist, Task 3 is BLOCKED until Story 1.1 completion
- **Verification**: Check `supabase/migrations/` for contractors table migration before proceeding

**Current System State:**
- Workers table should have contractor_id foreign key relationship
- Current admin job-sites pages are expecting job_sites table that doesn't exist yet
- RLS patterns follow authenticated admin access with auth.role() = 'authenticated'

### Database Architecture [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#database-architecture]
**Technology Stack:**
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL 17.4 (Australia East)
- Authentication: Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Security: Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables required
- Authorization: Role-based access (admin/worker/public)

**Current Tables:**
- `workers` - Employee records and certifications
- `certifications` - Safety compliance tracking  
- `projects` - Marketing portfolio items
- `contact_form_submissions` - Lead generation data

**SWMS Enhancement Tables [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#swms-enhancement-tables]:**
- `contractors` - Company records (from Story 1.1, may not exist yet)
- `swms_jobs` - SWMS assignments per job site
- `swms_submissions` - Contractor document submissions

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Database Migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` following timestamp convention YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_description.sql
- **TypeScript Types**: `src/types/supabase.generated.ts` (generated), `src/types/swms.ts` (custom)
- **Current Admin Pages**: `src/app/admin/job-sites/page.tsx` (references non-existent job_sites table)
- **Supabase Clients**: `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/client.ts`, `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts`

### Database Patterns [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#database-patterns]
**RLS Implementation Requirements:**
- All new tables must implement RLS policies
- Follow existing patterns in workers, certifications tables
- Use auth.role() = 'authenticated' for admin-only access
- Use auth.uid() for user-specific access where applicable

**Specific RLS Policy Patterns to Implement:**
```sql
-- Admin-only access pattern (job_sites, swms_jobs, swms_submissions)
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Admin full access" ON table_name FOR ALL TO authenticated USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Public read-only pattern (if needed for public pages)
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON table_name FOR SELECT TO anon USING (status = 'public');

-- Token-based contractor access pattern (for swms_submissions)
CREATE POLICY "Contractor token access" ON swms_submissions 
FOR SELECT TO anon 
USING (contractor_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM contractors WHERE magic_link_token = current_setting('request.jwt.claims.token', true)
));
```

**Query Patterns:**
```sql
-- Preferred: Type-safe queries with proper error handling
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('column1, column2')
  .eq('status', 'active')
```

**Migration Patterns:**
- Use IF NOT EXISTS for table creation
- Include proper indexes for foreign keys
- Enable RLS immediately after table creation
- Follow existing trigger patterns for updated_at timestamps

### Security Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#security-standards]
**Authentication Flow:**
1. Supabase Auth for admin users
2. Magic link tokens for contractor portals (future)
3. QR code tokens for worker check-in

**RLS Policy Requirements:**
- Admin tables: `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` for all operations
- Public access tables: Specific read-only policies
- Token-based access: Custom policies for portal access

### Performance Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-requirements]
**Backend Performance:**
- Database queries: < 200ms additional overhead
- Support for realistic SWMS data volumes (hundreds of jobs, thousands of submissions)

**Indexing Strategy:**
- Foreign key columns must be indexed
- Frequently queried columns (status, dates) need indexes
- Composite indexes for common query patterns
- Consider partial indexes for status-based queries

### Integration Requirements
**Existing System Integration:**
- Must not break current admin job-sites functionality
- Tables link to existing workers/contractors via foreign keys
- Follow established naming conventions and patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility

**API Integration Points [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-patterns]:**
- Extend existing `/api/admin/job-sites/*` endpoints (future stories)
- SWMS-specific routes following REST patterns
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints

### Testing Requirements [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
**Framework:**
- Jest + React Testing Library for any UI components
- Database migration testing using Supabase CLI
- Location: `__tests__` directories or `.test.ts` files

**Database Testing Requirements:**
- Migration up/down testing
- RLS policy testing with different user contexts
- Foreign key constraint testing
- Function testing with edge cases
- Performance testing with realistic data volumes

**Test Scenarios:**
- All tables create successfully with proper schema
- RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity  
- Database functions return expected results
- Indexes improve query performance as expected

### Testing
**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- **Location**: Database tests in `supabase/migrations/__tests__/` directory
- **Framework**: Supabase CLI for migration testing + Jest for function testing
- **Test File Pattern**: `{migration_timestamp}.test.js` for each migration
- **RLS Testing**: Use `supabase auth login` with test users for policy validation

**Required Test Categories:**
1. **Migration Tests**: Verify all tables/functions create successfully
2. **RLS Policy Tests**: Test with authenticated admin vs. unauthenticated users
3. **Foreign Key Tests**: Verify CASCADE delete behavior
4. **Function Tests**: Test all database functions with edge cases
5. **Performance Tests**: Verify query times < 200ms with sample data

**Test Data Requirements:**
- Minimum 100 job sites, 500 SWMS jobs, 1000 submissions for performance testing
- Test contractors table presence/absence scenarios
- Mock authentication contexts for RLS testing

### Code Quality Assessment

**SWMS DATABASE FOUNDATION IMPLEMENTED WITH COMPILATION ISSUES**

The SWMS data structure implementation is comprehensive and follows good database design principles. However, there are critical issues that need immediate attention:

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **TypeScript Compilation Failure**: The build fails due to type errors in `/admin/job-sites/[id]/page.tsx` (line 101-102)
   - `contractors` and `workers` are arrays but accessed as single objects
   - This prevents production deployment

2. **Test Suite Not Functional**: Migration tests fail with ReferenceError - Jest globals not properly configured
   - Tests exist but cannot validate the implementation

**Positive Aspects:**
- All required database tables created (job_sites, swms_jobs, swms_submissions, audit_log)
- Comprehensive RLS policies implemented following security patterns
- Performance optimization with indexes and materialized views
- Database functions for complex operations created
- Additional email campaign tables beyond story requirements

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed - TypeScript compilation errors must be fixed first before any code improvements.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✗ TypeScript compilation fails, preventing validation
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files properly organized in correct directories
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ Tests exist but fail to run due to configuration issues
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ Database structure created as specified

### Improvements Checklist

**Critical - Must Fix:**
- [ ] Fix TypeScript error in job-sites/[id]/page.tsx - contractors/workers array handling
- [ ] Configure Jest properly in migration tests (missing globals)
- [ ] Verify SWMS types file exists and is properly imported

**Recommended:**
- [ ] Add error boundaries for database query failures
- [ ] Implement retry logic for database operations
- [ ] Add monitoring for slow queries

### Security Review

**SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION ADEQUATE WITH OBSERVATIONS**

- ✅ RLS policies on all tables
- ✅ Proper authentication checks
- ⚠️ Token-based contractor access needs validation in production
- ⚠️ No rate limiting on database functions

### Performance Considerations

**GOOD PERFORMANCE DESIGN WITH RECOMMENDATIONS**

- ✅ Proper indexing strategy implemented
- ✅ Materialized views for dashboard metrics
- ⚠️ No connection pooling configuration visible
- ⚠️ Missing query timeout configurations

### Files Modified During Review

None - compilation errors prevent safe modifications

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.3-swms-data-structure-setup.yml

**Fail Rationale**: TypeScript compilation failure prevents production deployment. While the database implementation is solid, the application cannot build successfully.

**Quality Score**: 40/100 (Good database design, critical UI integration issues)

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Fix compilation errors before proceeding**

The following must be addressed:
1. Fix TypeScript array access in job-sites page
2. Resolve Jest configuration for tests
3. Ensure all type definitions are properly exported
