## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies & Prerequisites
**SWMS Data Structure Status (from Story 1.3):**
- **REQUIRED**: swms_submissions table MUST exist before implementing submission storage
- **Schema**: id (UUID), swms_job_id (UUID FK), contractor_id (UUID FK), document_name (TEXT), file_url (TEXT), status (TEXT), submitted_at, reviewed_at, reviewed_by (UUID), notes (TEXT), created_at, updated_at
- **Implementation**: If swms_submissions table doesn't exist, Task 5 is BLOCKED until Story 1.3 completion
- **Verification**: Check `supabase/migrations/` for SWMS tables migration before proceeding

**Contractors Table Dependency (from Story 1.1):**
- **REQUIRED**: Contractors table must exist for contractor_id foreign key relationship
- **Status**: Should be completed from Story 1.1 contractor-employee hierarchy foundation
- **Integration**: Portal must link submissions to existing contractor records

### Data Models [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#swms-enhancement-tables]
**SWMS Submissions Table:**
- Table: `swms_submissions` (created in Story 1.3)
- Primary purpose: Store contractor document submissions with full audit trail
- Key relationships: Links to swms_jobs (job assignments) and contractors (company records)
- Status workflow: submitted → under_review → approved/rejected
- File storage: Supabase Storage with signed URLs

**SWMS Jobs Table:**
- Table: `swms_jobs` (created in Story 1.3)
- Purpose: Define SWMS requirements per job site
- Contains: job_site_id, requirements, deadlines, status
- Token generation: Admin creates tokens for contractor access

### Authentication & Security [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md#authentication-authorization]
**Token-Based Security Model:**
- Method: UUID tokens with database validation (no account required)
- Scope: Single submission per token with job site restrictions
- Expiry: 7 days default, configurable by admin
- Validation: UUID lookup against swms_jobs table with active status check
- Pattern: Follow existing check-in token approach from `/check-in` system

**File Storage Security [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md#file-storage-security]:**
- Bucket Structure: `/swms-documents/job-sites/{job_id}/submissions/{contractor_id}/`
- Access Control: RLS + signed URLs with 24-hour expiry
- Encryption: AES-256 at rest (Supabase managed)
- Virus Scanning: Edge Function integration with external service
- File Limits: 10MB max per file, PDF/DOC/DOCX/JPG/PNG formats only

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#public-swms-portal]
**Portal Routes (to be created):**

- Use Supabase Storage client for file operations
- Implement progressive upload with status tracking
- Return signed URLs for file access

**Email Integration:**
- Follow existing notification patterns from `notify-builder` Edge Function
- Send confirmation emails to contractor contact_email
- Use existing email templates structure and SMTP configuration

- Admin full access: `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` for admin management
- Read-only public access for status checking (no sensitive data exposure)

**File Storage Policies:**
- Contractor can upload: Own documents only, linked to their submissions
- Admin can access: All files with full management capabilities
- Audit logging: All file operations logged for compliance

### Integration with Existing Systems
**Check-in System Pattern Reuse:**
- Token URL structure: `/swms-portal/[token]` mirrors `/check-in` pattern
- Geolocation integration: Optional location verification for job site matching
- QR code generation: Admin can generate QR codes for contractor access
- Mobile optimization: Reuse responsive design patterns from check-in interface

**Admin Interface Integration:**
- Token management in existing job sites admin pages
- Submission review interface integrated into SWMS management
- Notification integration with existing alert systems

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD** - Implementation demonstrates solid architecture following established patterns with comprehensive token validation, proper file handling, and security measures. Code is well-structured, type-safe, and follows project conventions.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent token validation with UUID format checking, expiration handling, and comprehensive error states
- Mobile-first responsive design using established Shadcn/ui patterns
- Proper file upload validation (size, type, virus scanning preparation)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Good separation of concerns (server actions, components, types)
- Database schema properly extends existing SWMS infrastructure

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/swms/FileUpload.tsx`
- **Change**: Fixed callback dependency in `retryUpload` function (line 189-190)
- **Why**: Function was incorrectly trying to call itself instead of the `uploadFile` function
- **How**: Changed `uploadFile({ ...uploadFile, status: 'pending', error: undefined })` to `uploadFile(uploadFile)` and updated the upload file state properly

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows TypeScript strict mode, proper component structure, explicit interfaces, import organization
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Good** - Files organized according to source-tree.md, proper co-location of server actions
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **Missing** - No portal-specific tests found, critical gap for token validation and file upload flows  
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Yes** - All 5 acceptance criteria implemented with comprehensive functionality

### Improvements Checklist

**Security & Validation:**
- [x] Token validation with proper UUID format checking (actions.ts:49-56)
- [x] File type and size validation implemented (FileUpload.tsx:40-49, upload-actions.ts:37-53)
- [x] CSRF protection via server actions pattern
- [x] Database RLS policies for token-based access (migration:33-39)

**Testing Gaps (HIGH PRIORITY):**
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add portal-specific unit tests for token validation edge cases
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add file upload component tests (drag-and-drop, validation, error states)
- [ ] **HIGH**: Add integration tests for end-to-end submission flow
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add mobile responsiveness tests
- [ ] **MEDIUM**: Add security tests for unauthorized access scenarios

**Code Quality:**

- [x] Proper TypeScript interfaces and error handling
- [x] Mobile optimization with responsive design
- [ ] Consider extracting file validation logic to shared utility for reuse
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments for complex token validation logic

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- UUID-based token system with proper expiration handling
- Server-side file validation prevents malicious uploads  
- RLS policies restrict access to authorized contractors only
- Signed URLs for file access with 24-hour expiry
- Proper authentication checks in admin functions

**Areas for Monitoring:**
- File virus scanning integration is mocked - needs real implementation
- Rate limiting mentioned but not implemented in current code
- No explicit CSRF token validation beyond Next.js built-ins

### Performance Considerations

**Well Implemented:**
- Progressive file upload with status tracking
- Proper file size limits (10MB) to prevent abuse
- Indexed database queries for token validation
- Efficient storage bucket structure for organization

**Future Optimizations:**
- Consider image compression for large photo uploads
- Implement upload retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Add offline queue for failed uploads in mobile scenarios

### Files Modified During Review

**Modified:**
- `apps/web/src/components/swms/FileUpload.tsx` - Fixed retry upload callback bug

**Files Needing Dev Update to File List:**
- None - bug fix was minor and doesn't require File List update

### Gate Status

Gate: **CONCERNS** → docs/qa/gates/1.4-contractor-submission-portal.yml

**Primary Concerns:**
1. **Missing Test Coverage** - No portal-specific tests for critical security functionality
2. **Incomplete Security Implementation** - Virus scanning and rate limiting mentioned but not fully implemented

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical Testing Gap**

**Must Address Before Production:**
1. Add comprehensive test suite for portal token validation
2. Add file upload component tests with mock implementations
3. Implement or mock virus scanning integration
4. Add integration tests for submission workflow
