## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies & Prerequisites
**SWMS Data Structure Status (from Story 1.3):**
- **REQUIRED**: swms_submissions table MUST exist before implementing submission storage
- **Schema**: id (UUID), swms_job_id (UUID FK), contractor_id (UUID FK), document_name (TEXT), file_url (TEXT), status (TEXT), submitted_at, reviewed_at, reviewed_by (UUID), notes (TEXT), created_at, updated_at
- **Implementation**: If swms_submissions table doesn't exist, Task 5 is BLOCKED until Story 1.3 completion
- **Verification**: Check `supabase/migrations/` for SWMS tables migration before proceeding

**Contractors Table Dependency (from Story 1.1):**
- **REQUIRED**: Contractors table must exist for contractor_id foreign key relationship
- **Status**: Should be completed from Story 1.1 contractor-employee hierarchy foundation
- **Integration**: Portal must link submissions to existing contractor records

### Data Models [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#swms-enhancement-tables]
**SWMS Submissions Table:**
- Table: `swms_submissions` (created in Story 1.3)
- Primary purpose: Store contractor document submissions with full audit trail
- Key relationships: Links to swms_jobs (job assignments) and contractors (company records)
- Status workflow: submitted → under_review → approved/rejected
- File storage: Supabase Storage with signed URLs

**SWMS Jobs Table:**
- Table: `swms_jobs` (created in Story 1.3)
- Purpose: Define SWMS requirements per job site
- Contains: job_site_id, requirements, deadlines, status
- Token generation: Admin creates tokens for contractor access

### Authentication & Security [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md#authentication-authorization]
**Token-Based Security Model:**
- Method: UUID tokens with database validation (no account required)
- Scope: Single submission per token with job site restrictions
- Expiry: 7 days default, configurable by admin
- Validation: UUID lookup against swms_jobs table with active status check
- Pattern: Follow existing check-in token approach from `/check-in` system

**File Storage Security [Source: architecture/security-architecture.md#file-storage-security]:**
- Bucket Structure: `/swms-documents/job-sites/{job_id}/submissions/{contractor_id}/`
- Access Control: RLS + signed URLs with 24-hour expiry
- Encryption: AES-256 at rest (Supabase managed)
- Virus Scanning: Edge Function integration with external service
- File Limits: 10MB max per file, PDF/DOC/DOCX/JPG/PNG formats only

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: GOOD** - Implementation demonstrates solid architecture following established patterns with comprehensive token validation, proper file handling, and security measures. Code is well-structured, type-safe, and follows project conventions.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent token validation with UUID format checking, expiration handling, and comprehensive error states
- Mobile-first responsive design using established Shadcn/ui patterns
- Proper file upload validation (size, type, virus scanning preparation)
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Good separation of concerns (server actions, components, types)
- Database schema properly extends existing SWMS infrastructure

### Refactoring Performed

**File**: `apps/web/src/components/swms/FileUpload.tsx`
- **Change**: Fixed callback dependency in `retryUpload` function (line 189-190)
- **Why**: Function was incorrectly trying to call itself instead of the `uploadFile` function
- **How**: Changed `uploadFile({ ...uploadFile, status: 'pending', error: undefined })` to `uploadFile(uploadFile)` and updated the upload file state properly

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows TypeScript strict mode, proper component structure, explicit interfaces, import organization
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Good** - Files organized according to source-tree.md, proper co-location of server actions
- **Testing Strategy**: ✗ **Missing** - No portal-specific tests found, critical gap for token validation and file upload flows  
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Yes** - All 5 acceptance criteria implemented with comprehensive functionality
