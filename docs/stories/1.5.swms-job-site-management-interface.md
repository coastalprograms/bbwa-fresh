## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies & Prerequisites
**Database Foundation Status (from Story 1.3):**
- **REQUIRED**: All SWMS database tables MUST exist before implementation
- **Tables Required**: job_sites, swms_jobs, swms_submissions, contractors (from Story 1.1)
- **Functions Required**: calculate_swms_completion_rate(), get_swms_job_with_submissions()
- **Verification**: Story 1.3 shows "Ready for Review" status - database foundation is complete
- **Implementation Note**: All database functions and tables are available for use

**Contractors Management Status (from Story 1.2):**
- **REQUIRED**: Contractors management interface should be available for reference
- **Integration**: SWMS submissions link to contractor records via contractor_id FK
- **Status**: Should be completed for proper contractor display in submission tables

### Data Models [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#swms-enhancement-tables]
**SWMS Jobs Table:**
- Table: `swms_jobs` (created in Story 1.3)
- Schema: id (UUID), job_site_id (UUID FK), name (TEXT), description (TEXT), start_date (DATE), end_date (DATE), status (TEXT)
- Relationships: Links to job_sites via job_site_id FK with CASCADE delete
- Status Values: "draft", "active", "completed", "cancelled"
- Purpose: Define SWMS requirements and assignments for specific job sites

**SWMS Submissions Table:**
- Table: `swms_submissions` (created in Story 1.3)
- Schema: id (UUID), swms_job_id (UUID FK), contractor_id (UUID FK), document_name (TEXT), file_url (TEXT), status (TEXT), submitted_at, reviewed_at, reviewed_by (UUID), notes (TEXT)
- Status Values: "submitted", "under_review", "approved", "rejected", "revision_required"
- Purpose: Store contractor document submissions with full audit trail

**Available Database Functions [Source: Story 1.3 implementation]:**
- `calculate_swms_completion_rate(job_site_id UUID)` - Returns completion percentage for metrics
- `get_swms_job_with_submissions(job_id UUID)` - Returns joined SWMS job with submission data
- `update_swms_submission_status(submission_id UUID, new_status TEXT, reviewer_id UUID)` - Status updates with audit
- `get_contractor_swms_submissions(contractor_id UUID)` - Contractor-specific submissions

### File Locations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#swms-integration-points]

- **Admin Sidebar**: `src/components/admin/AppSidebar.tsx` (no changes needed - using existing job-sites nav)
- **KPI Cards**: `src/app/admin/_components/KpiCard.tsx` (extend for SWMS metrics)

### API Integration Points [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#api-patterns]
**Existing Endpoints to Extend:**
- `/api/admin/job-sites/[id]` - Add SWMS data to job site details response
- `/api/admin/job-sites` - Include SWMS metrics in job sites list

**Server Actions Pattern [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#server-actions-pattern]:**
```typescript
'use server'
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache'

export async function createSwmsJob(
  jobSiteId: string, 
  data: SwmsJobCreateData
): Promise<{ success: boolean; error?: string; data?: SwmsJob }> {
  try {
    const supabase = createClient()
    
    const { data: swmsJob, error } = await supabase
      .from('swms_jobs')
      .insert({
        job_site_id: jobSiteId,
        ...data
      })
      .select()
      .single()
      
    if (error) throw error
    
    revalidatePath(`/admin/job-sites/${jobSiteId}`)
    return { success: true, data: swmsJob }
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error.message }
  }
}
```

### Component Specifications [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#component-guidelines]
**SWMS Integration Patterns:**
- Follow existing admin UI patterns from job-sites pages
- Use Shadcn/ui components (Card, Table, Badge, Button, Form)
- Maintain responsive design for mobile administration
- Follow accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.2 AA compliance)

**Status Badge Component Pattern:**
```typescript
interface SwmsStatusBadgeProps {
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'completed' | 'cancelled'
  submissionCount?: number
  totalExpected?: number
}

// Use existing badge color patterns:
// draft: "secondary", active: "default", completed: "success", cancelled: "destructive"
```

**Metrics Card Integration:**
- Extend existing KpiCard component pattern
- Include completion percentages and trending indicators  
- Support drill-down navigation to detailed SWMS views
- Display real-time data using database functions

### Authentication & Authorization [Source: architecture/infrastructure-architecture.md#api-security-architecture]
**Admin Access Requirements:**
- All SWMS management requires `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` (Supabase Auth JWT)
- RLS policies already implemented in Story 1.3 for admin full access
- Server actions must validate authentication before database operations

**Security Pattern for SWMS Operations:**
```typescript
// All SWMS server actions must include this pattern
const supabase = createClient() // Uses authenticated context
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized')
```

### Performance Requirements [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#performance-requirements]
**Database Query Optimization:**
- Use database functions for complex SWMS metrics calculation
- Implement proper pagination for submission tables (limit 50 per page)
- Use composite indexes from Story 1.3 for efficient queries
- Cache frequently accessed metrics using Next.js caching

**Frontend Performance:**
- Lazy load SWMS sections to maintain existing job-sites page speed
- Use React.memo() for SWMS components that receive frequent updates
- Optimize submission file downloads with signed URL caching

### Integration with Existing Systems
**Job Sites Admin Page Integration:**
- Extend existing job site list with SWMS status badges
- Add SWMS metrics to job site detail views
- Maintain existing job site CRUD functionality without disruption
- Use existing error handling and loading patterns

**Data Flow Integration:**
- SWMS jobs inherit job_site_id, lat, lng, address from parent job site
- Submission status updates trigger automatic completion rate recalculation
- Admin actions (approve/reject) update both submission status and audit logs

### Testing

**Testing Framework Requirements:**
- **Location**: SWMS admin tests in `src/app/admin/job-sites/__tests__/swms/` directory
- **Framework**: Jest + React Testing Library for components, existing patterns
- **Component Testing**: Test all new SWMS components in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: Test SWMS functionality within existing job-sites pages

**Required Test Categories:**
1. **Component Tests**: All SWMS components render correctly with various data states
2. **Integration Tests**: SWMS sections integrate properly with existing job-sites admin
3. **Server Action Tests**: Mock Supabase client for SWMS job creation/updates
4. **Status Display Tests**: Visual indicators update correctly with status changes
5. **Metrics Tests**: SWMS statistics calculate and display properly
6. **Responsive Tests**: Mobile and desktop layout testing for SWMS interfaces

**Test Data Requirements:**
- Mock job sites with various SWMS job configurations
- Sample SWMS submissions in different status states
- Contractor records for submission display testing
- Authentication contexts for admin access testing
