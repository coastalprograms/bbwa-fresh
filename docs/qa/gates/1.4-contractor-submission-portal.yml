code_quality_notes: |
  Implementation demonstrates solid software engineering practices:
  - Proper TypeScript usage with strict mode and explicit interfaces
  - Good separation of concerns between server actions, components, and data layers
  - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly error messages
  - Mobile-first responsive design following established UI patterns
  - Security-conscious design with token validation and file restrictions
  
  Minor bug fixed during review: FileUpload retry callback was incorrectly structured.
  
  Architecture follows established project patterns and integrates well with existing SWMS infrastructure.
