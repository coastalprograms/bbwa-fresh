# Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

Based on the detailed analysis of the existing BBWA system architecture, here are the technical constraints and integration requirements for safe SWMS implementation:

## Existing Technology Stack

**Current Architecture (Validated)**:
- **Languages**: TypeScript (strict mode), JavaScript (ES2022+)
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components, Radix UI primitives
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL 17.4, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation patterns
- **Deployment**: Netlify with existing configuration
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with `/admin` route protection

## Integration Approach

**Database Integration Strategy**:
New contractors table (CR2) will be created first to establish contractor-employee relationships, with workers table updated to include contractor_id foreign key. SWMS tables will then extend existing schema through proper foreign key relationships to both `job_sites.id` and the new `contractors.id`, maintaining referential integrity with current geo-location and check-in systems. Migration scripts will follow existing patterns in `supabase/migrations/` with proper rollback capabilities and RLS policy implementation matching current security model.

**API Integration Strategy**:
SWMS functionality will extend existing `/api/admin/job-sites/` endpoints rather than creating separate API routes, ensuring consistent authentication, error handling, and response formatting. New Edge Functions for email automation will follow proven patterns from `notify-builder`, `expiry-reminders`, and `process-white-card` functions.

**Frontend Integration Strategy**:
SWMS components will extend existing `JobSiteForm.tsx` and related admin components using established patterns from worker and project management interfaces. All new components will use existing Shadcn/ui library, form validation patterns, and state management approaches proven in current admin dashboard.

**Testing Integration Strategy**:
SWMS features will integrate with existing Jest + React Testing Library test suite, following established patterns from current admin component tests and API route testing. Critical path testing will focus on SWMS workflow integration with existing job site and contractor management flows.

## Code Organization and Standards

**File Structure Approach**:
SWMS functionality will be organized within existing admin directory structure:
- `/admin/job-sites/` - Enhanced with SWMS management sections
- `/api/admin/job-sites/` - Extended endpoints for SWMS operations  
- `/components/admin/` - New SWMS-specific components following existing patterns
- `supabase/functions/` - New Edge Functions for email automation following existing naming conventions

**Naming Conventions**:
All SWMS-related files will follow existing kebab-case naming for components (`swms-management.tsx`), camelCase for hooks (`useSWMSData.ts`), and existing Supabase patterns for database objects (`swms_jobs`, `swms_submissions`, `contractors` tables).

**Coding Standards**:
SWMS implementation will adhere to existing TypeScript strict mode requirements, ESLint configuration, Prettier formatting rules, and established patterns for error boundaries, loading states, and form handling used throughout current admin interface.

**Documentation Standards**:
All SWMS functions will include explicit TypeScript types, JSDoc comments for complex logic, and README updates in relevant directories following existing documentation patterns for worker management and compliance systems.

## Deployment and Operations

**Build Process Integration**:
SWMS features will integrate seamlessly with existing `npm run build` process, requiring no changes to current Netlify deployment configuration or build optimization settings. TypeScript compilation and bundling will leverage existing Next.js configuration and performance optimization patterns.

**Deployment Strategy**:
SWMS functionality will be deployed through existing Netlify deployment pipeline with feature flags for gradual rollout. Database migrations will be applied via existing Supabase migration workflow, ensuring zero-downtime deployment consistent with current operational practices.

**Monitoring and Logging**:
SWMS operations will integrate with existing Supabase logging infrastructure, using established patterns from current compliance alert and notification audit systems. All SWMS database operations will be logged to existing audit tables (`notification_audits`, `certification_audits`) for compliance tracking.

**Configuration Management**:
SWMS features will use existing environment variable patterns (`.env.local`, Netlify environment settings) and leverage current Supabase configuration management for service keys, webhook URLs, and email automation settings.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

**Technical Risks (Based on Existing System Analysis)**:
- **Database Performance**: Additional SWMS queries on `job_sites` table could impact existing check-in performance; mitigated through proper indexing and query optimization following existing patterns
- **Supabase Limits**: Increased Edge Function usage for email automation may approach current plan limits; monitoring and optimization strategies based on existing function patterns
- **Email Deliverability**: Contractor email automation could face spam filtering; addressed through existing domain authentication and gradual sending patterns

**Integration Risks**:
- **Admin UI Complexity**: Adding SWMS sections to existing job site forms could impact usability; mitigated through progressive enhancement and consistent component patterns
- **Data Consistency**: Contractor information synchronization between Airtable and SWMS could create conflicts; addressed through existing API integration patterns and proper error handling
- **Authentication Dependencies**: SWMS admin features dependent on existing Supabase Auth; risk mitigation through established session management and fallback patterns

**Deployment Risks**:
- **Migration Complexity**: Database schema changes could impact existing job site functionality; mitigated through comprehensive migration testing and rollback procedures
- **Performance Regression**: Additional admin interface complexity could slow existing workflows; addressed through performance monitoring and incremental feature rollout
- **Feature Flag Management**: Gradual SWMS rollout requires careful feature flag coordination; managed through existing deployment practices and configuration management

**Mitigation Strategies**:
All technical risks will be addressed through established patterns proven in existing worker compliance, certification management, and admin dashboard implementations. Database changes will use existing migration patterns with proper foreign key constraints and RLS policies. Performance monitoring will leverage current Supabase analytics and Netlify deployment monitoring for consistent operational oversight.
