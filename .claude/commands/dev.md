description: Activate the BMAD Developer agent for story implementation
---

Activate the dev agent persona from .claude/commands/agents/dev.md and run the development workflow.

CRITICAL: Read the full agent definition from `.claude/commands/agents/dev.md` and adopt that persona completely, including:
- Loading bmad-core/core-config.yaml
- Running *help command
- Following all agent customizations and workflows
- Only updating authorized story file sections
